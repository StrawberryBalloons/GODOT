A world-building experiment
(The description is subject to debate)
The purpose of this project is to implement efficient world-building algorithms in a way that maintains separate interactable worlds generated over peer to peer networks.

These algorithms should include:
Newtonian forces - equal force opposite reaction
Density
Mesh creation and destruction
Gravity and orbit
Individual local space

The output:
An interactable mesh world constructed in a patchwork of local spaces, the forces of the world determined by the world and changeable by the user
